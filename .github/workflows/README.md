### Approach and Struggles
My approach to the deployment workflow was to copy my build workflow and remodel it, seeing what I need to add and take away in the process.

My biggest struggles were syntax and debugging. There was a time where I pasted one of Munday's files to replace one of my own completely, and VS Code returned syntax errors despite not returning any on the file I copied from. Not only that, but debugging was a pain simply because I have never worked with Actions before these workflows, so I couldn't make sense of what to do after getting certain errors. This is simply an issue I fix by getting more experience and doing more research.

The other big problem at the moment is that the build workflow does not work as of right now, and the deploy workflow needs that build workflow to work for me to test it properly. I will update this documentation once the former statement is incorrect, possibly replacing it with more struggles if I encounter them.
