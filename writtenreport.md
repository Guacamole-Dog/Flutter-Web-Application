## Introduction
CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines are loosely defined systems that have the ability to automatically integrate changes into and deploy a given application. They are loosely defined in the sense that their function can be performed in a number of different ways (from GitHub Actions to tests and protocols made from scratch), leading to varying degrees of success (most notably quantified by code coverage), but as long as it allows for automatic integration of updates and deployment of software, it is a CI/CD pipeline. CI/CD pipelines are irreplaceably valuable in modern software development because they cut down on several tedious aspects of debugging new code contributions. Developers can find out exactly which contributions caused errors and what parts of the contributions failed a given test with no back-and-forth between other developers, no confusing mixups, and no need for discovery, all while the working contributions are automatically integrated and pushed out to improve the software.
