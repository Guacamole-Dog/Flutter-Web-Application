# CI/CD Pipelines

## Environment
My CI/CD pipeline operates at a web level through the use of GitHub. Since it is integrated and deployed to a website instead of a download, the user's operating system does not matter as long as it can access the web.
The deployment is provided through GitHub's cloud and network, but network configurations that blacklist web access are a concern when deploying the application.



Your task is to draft the CI/CD pipeline section of your semester project report. Your draft should encompass the following components:

CI/CD Pipeline Environment:
Describe the infrastructure and environment where your CI/CD pipeline operates. Consider factors such as operating systems, cloud services, and network configurations.

CI/CD Pipeline Tools:
Identify and justify the selection of tools used in your CI/CD pipeline. Discuss their features, strengths, and limitations. Common tools include Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitHub Actions.

Automation Process:
Outline the process for automating the build and deployment phases of your CI/CD pipeline. Include steps for code compilation, unit testing, integration testing, and deployment to production or staging environments.
